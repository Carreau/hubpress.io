= Jupyter Blog 

This is a test to use [hubpress.io](adress) as a blog engine for the Jupyter.org blog. 

For now it uses *asciidoc* as a  _format_ to write blog post, but I suppose it can be use with markdown once the full sourcecode is released. 

Anyway, just to see how this look. And as this updates code, we can do proper PR and reviews.
